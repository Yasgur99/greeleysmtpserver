The Greeley SMTP Server Project (2017 edition)

This project was created by the Horace Greeley High School Computer Science Club. The goal of this project is to create a
functional SMTP server. I ended up making this my Advanced Topics in Computer Science Course final project where I worked on mail relay,bug fies, database access, and better implementation of the RFC standards.
